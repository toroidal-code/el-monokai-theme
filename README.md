Monokai Color Theme for Emacs 24
================================

This project is a continuation of previous work by @lvillani. Its aims
is to provide a lighter alternative to the more complete version of
[oneKelvinSmith](https://github.com/oneKelvinSmith/monokai-emacs).


Installation
============

This package was available from
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/). Old required files to allow it
are always available, but I don't plan to support it.

To enable it, add this line to your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`
file:

    (load-file "/path/to/monokai-theme.el")
